/**
U4OpticalSurfaceFinish.h
===========================

Basis G4OpticalSurfaceFinish enum { polished, polishedfrontpainted, ... }
is defined in G4OpticalSurface.hh

Note that the 6 finish types are only the first of 30 or so.
Only finish types used by active geometries have any hope of being supported.
