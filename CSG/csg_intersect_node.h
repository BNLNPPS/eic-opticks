csg_intersect_node.h
=======================

This header must be included after csg_intersect_leaf.h and before csg_intersect_tree.h

Providing more types of multi-union or multi-intersection allows the user to communicate 
more precisely hence a simpler less general algorithm more suited 
to the specific geometry can be applied.

CSG_DISCONTIGUOUS (possible alt names: CSG_DISJOINT, CSG_SEPERATED
    "multi-union" that the user guarantees to have no overlap between nodes, 
    for example a menagerie of different primitives arranged such that there are all entirely disconnected
    (useful for modelling "holes" to be subtracted from another shape)

CSG_CONTIGUOUS (hmm need better name, not CSG_MULTIUNION because the constituents must be primitives)
    "multi-union" which is expected to be mostly overlapped but ray paths with "gaps" eg from 
    corners or L-shapes are permitted by doing the disjoint disqualification in the intersect alg

CSG_OVERLAP
    "multi-intersection" where user guarantees the compound shape has the topology of a ball with no concaves     
    ie the paths of all possible rays crossing the geometry always find two intersects,  
    other than tangential edge case

* can tell are outside all constituents (and hence the compound) 
  when *ALL* first intersects on constituents are state ENTER 
  [this assumes non-complemented constituents]
  (this is because EXIT is shielded by the corresponding ENTER) 

  * -> compound intersect is the closest ENTER (that fulfils t_min)

  * HMM: notice that having a t_min that eats into that external intersect
    makes the starting point effectively t_min ahead (so outside/inside talk
    needs to bear that in mind) 

  * WHAT IS RELEVANT IS THE OUTSIDE/INSIDE OF THE +t_min EFFECTIVE START POINT

* when *ANY* EXIT states are obtained from first intersects this means 
  are inside the CONTIGUOUS compound

  * this is true in general for CONTIGUOUS compounds as are considering intersects 
    with all constituents and constituents do not "shield" each other : so will 
    always manage to have a first intersect that EXITs when start inside any of them 

  * to find the compound intersect are forced to find all the EXITS 
    for all the consituents that found ENTERs for  


ALG ISSUE : DOES NOT HONOUR t_min CUTTING : PRESUMABLY DUE TO MIXING DISTANCE AND INTERSECT ?

* fixied by checking insideness of : ray_origin + t_min*ray_direction  ?
* TODO: check get expected t_min behaviour, that is: cutaway sphere in perspective projection around origin
  (correct t_min behaviour is a requirement to participate in CSG trees)


PROBLEMS WITH USING DISTANCE FUNCTION 

Using distance_node_contiguous feels "impure" as it mixes volume-centric with surface-centric approaches
plus it comes with some issues:

1. kinda duplicitous : as will be running intersect_leaf on all sub_node anyhow
2. using a second way of getting the same info (with another float cut) feels likely to cause edge issues 
3. distance functions are not yet implemented for all leaf 
  
ADVANTAGE OF USING DISTANCE FUNCTION 

Knowing inside_or_surface ahead of time allows:

1. single loop over leaves (BUT there is a hidden loop inside distance_node_contiguous)
2. avoids storing ENTER/EXIT states and distances for isect  
 
   * expect this to be is a big GPU performance advantage (more storage less in flight)
   * especially advantageous as this shape is targetting CSG boolean abuse solids with large numbers of leaves 
   * from future : note that cannot avoid storing t_enter to properly get furthest exit that is not disjoint 
     making the case to eliminate the distance function

THOUGHTS ON ROOT CAUSE

Need to know all isect are ENTER before can decide that do not need to find the EXITs.
Put another way : if any EXIT encountered, must promote all ENTER into EXIT, 
and doing this requires the ENTER distance. 
If the EXIT is obtained immediately after the ENTER that avoids having to store the ENTER distance. 
  
How important is the only ENTER optimization is unclear : would need to measure for specific geometry.
BUT : really want to avoid storing all isect if at all possible. 

FORGO ALL ENTER "OPTIMIZATION"

* no need to know inside_or_surface 
* just one loop and promote all ENTER to EXIT would also avoid the need to store all isect 


TODO: implement in several different ways and test performance for a variety of shapes


ISSUE WHEN USED IN TREE

Checking this within a CSG tree boolean combination reveals that it is an 
over simplification to just return the furthest exit as it misses intermediate exits
that prevents the CSG tree intersection from working.

Enters and exits that are within the compound must not raise an intersect 
but when a enter or exit transitions in or out of the compound an intersect must 
be returned even when there is a subsequent one further along. 

How to do that without lots of distance calls ?
Perhaps a depth counter can distinguish between internal 
and external borders.

But the alg works by looping over ALL constituents

* classifying Enter/Exit
* when get an Enter, also get the corresponding Exit

* there can be subsequnet Enters after an Exit, but that would have to be 
  handled by another call to the intersect with advanced tmin : because 
  only the next isect with the compound at t > tmin is returned


So in the above:

   A: Exit at t=3  (-1)
   B: Enter at t=1 (-1+1=0), Exit at t=2 (0-1 = -1)

For rays starting in A or B need to disqualify C intersects because 
the C enters are at greater t than the A and B exits.

If C expanded to the left to join with A and B then that would not 
be the case and its exits would be allowed.  

Any of the A,B,C can be disjoint and need to detect and disqualify.

HMM: should any constituent with an Enter exceeding 

HMM: when are inside are in need of an exit, but if a constituent
gives you an enter it is under suspicion of needing disqualification.

HMM: need to distinguish first-exits from second-exits (obtained after an enter) 

The farthest first-exit is highly likely to be THE ONE, but 
not inevitably.  So on first loop collect the farthest first exit 

Perhaps can disqualify constituents with Enter that is 
further away that the farthest first-exit. 


What about a chain, perhaps repeated pushing 
of envelope prevents the two pass approach ?

2. *second pass* : redo the undone that are all State_Enter, looping subs with enter less than furthest exit 
   
   * only E1 qualifies, looping that takes you to X4 






1. *zeroth pass* : hoping that are outside just find nearest enter and count first exits 

2. when no Exits are outside the compound which makes the intersect simply the closest enter, so return it  

3. *first pass* : collect enter distances, isub indices and get farthest_exit of the first exits 

   * first exits always qualify as potential intersects, it is only exits after an enter that may be disjoint 
     and require contiguity checking before can qualify as candidate intersect
