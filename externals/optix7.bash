OptiX 7 : Brand New Lower Level API
=======================================

revisit optix7c-cd and SDK 



Multi GPU
-----------


* https://github.com/NVIDIA/OptiX_Apps

::

    rtigo3 is meant as a testbed for multi-GPU rendering distribution and OpenGL
    interoperability. There are different multi-GPU strategies implemented (single
    GPU, dual GPU peer-to-peer, multi-GPU pinned memory, multi-GPU local
    distribution and compositing). Then there are three different OpenGL interop
    modes (none, render to pixel buffer object, copy to mapped texture array).

* :google:`single GPU, dual GPU peer-to-peer, multi-GPU pinned memory, multi-GPU local distribution`


Given that the simulation of every genstep is independent of all others, 
optical photon simulation on multiple GPUs should be able to use the simplest 
of multi-GPU techniques. Thats got to be good for development time and performance.

* https://medium.com/gpgpu/multi-gpu-programming-6768eeb42e2c
* https://github.com/senior-zero?tab=repositories

The above has a simple example of using multiple CPU threads where each CPU thread 
talks with a different GPU cudaSetDevice. 




Program Group Creation

Callables
-----------

* https://raytracing-docs.nvidia.com/optix7/guide/index.html#callables#callables

Two types of callable programs exist in NVIDIA OptiX 7: direct callables and
continuation callables. Unlike direct callables, continuation callables can
call the function optixTrace. Direct callables are called immediately, but
because of their additional capability, continuation callables need to be
executed by the scheduler. This may result in additional overhead when running
continuation callables.

OptiX 7 OpenGL interop
------------------------

* https://forums.developer.nvidia.com/t/opengl-in-optix-7/83142

dhart Oct 2019::

OptiX 6.5 and earlier needs explicit interop since the handles you get from
OptiX are not native device pointers. Since OptiX 7 uses raw device pointers
and explicit CUDA streams, like you pointed out, OptiX doesn’t need any interop
functionality beyond the interop you can find with CUDA. This goes for OpenGL
as well as DirectX and Vulkan too. So the way to think about it is with OptiX
6.5 and earlier you need OpenGL-OptiX interop, and with OptiX 7+ you need
OpenGL-CUDA interop. There is still an explicit API for interop, but the API is
CUDA functions rather than OptiX functions.

All three of those APIs have some limitations in their interop with CUDA since
they all deal in opaque buffer objects like OptiX used to. So you just need to
draw from the knowledge base of OpenGL-CUDA interop in order to use OpenGL with
OptiX 7. This set of slides is a bit dated, but I think still relevant to
OpenGL-CUDA interop https://www.nvidia.com/content/GTC/documents/1055_GTC09.pdf

From OptiX 7.2 Release Notes : **Specialization**
-----------------------------------------------------

What's New in 7.2.0 

Specialization is a powerful new feature that allows
renderers to maintain generality while increasing performance on specific use
cases. A single version of the PTX can be supplied to OptiX and specialized to
toggle specific features on and off. The OptiX compiler is leveraged to fold
constant values and elide complex code that is not required by a particular
scene setup. Specialized values are supplied during module creation with
OptixModuleCompileOptions::boundValues. See the Programming Guide section
6.3.1, “Parameter specialization”, and the optixBoundValues sample.

Thus, there should be at least one Shader Record in the table for each unique
combination of shader functions and embedded parameters.
It is possible to write the same shader record multiple times in the table, and
this may be necessary depending on how the instances and geometries in the
scene are setup. Finally, it is also possible to use the instance and geometry
IDs available in the shaders to perform indirect access into other tables
containing the scene data.


Ray Generation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Ray Generation shader record consists of a single function referring to the
ray generation shader to be called, along with any desired embedded parameters
for the function. While some parameters can be passed in the shader record, **for
parameters that get updated each frame (e.g., the camera position) it is better
to pass them separately through a different globally accessible buffer**. While
multiple ray generation shaders can be written into the table, only one can be
called for a launch.

Hit Group
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each Hit Group shader record consists of a Closest Hit shader, Any Hit shader
(optional) and Intersection shader (optional), followed by the set of embedded
parameters to be made available to the three shaders. As the hit group which
should be called is dependent on the instance and geometry which were hit and
the ray type, the indexing rules for hit groups are the most complicated. The
rules for hit group indexing are discussed in detail below.

Hit Group Shader Record Index Calculation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The main point of difficulty in setting up the SBT and scene geometry is
understanding how the two are coupled together, i.e., if a geometry is hit by a
ray, which shader record is called? The shader record to call is determined by
parameters set on the instance, trace ray call, and the order of geometries in
the bottom-level acceleration structure. These parameters are set on both the
host and device during different parts of the scene and pipeline setup and
execution, making it difficult to see how they fit together.

::

   HG=&HG[0]+(HGstride×(Roffset+Rstride×GID+Ioffset))(1)

[Yes, that is a good way to think off it as can then write a CPU side
 dumper for the SBT table]

Notes
~~~~~~~

-35:00
     SBT links together programs, program data and geometry
 
-34:00
     pipeline is for the programs, not the program data   

-32:00
     one level instancing is "free" : done in hardware
     if you have a mix of instances and GAS, just add a dummy instance ove the GAS

-31:50
     attributes use registers and are expensive, do not duplicate the built-ins

-31:14
     typically cheaper to recompute the surface normal than to pass attribute from IN to CH
     (huh: do not follow that, because direction of normal depends on geometry ?)

-30:30
     PRD payload, 2x32bit encoding a 64bit pointer to local struct in raygen program

     * using this can write into the local variables of the raygen program from the CH 
     * the examples in the accompanying code do this 2 payload slots encoding a 64bit pointer

-27:43
    Programs comopiled at ProgramGroup granularity

-26:21
    Pipeline hooks up the graph of programGropys, not the data : that comes later

-24:40
    That Tricky Thing : SBT 

-23:07
    SBT specifies which program gets called - with which data - when a given ray hits a given object.

-22:41
    programmatic mapping using a formula based on:

    a) which of the build inputs for a GAS was hit
    b) numSBTRecords in GAS and sbtOffsets in IAS
    c) index and stride from trace call  

    outcome is an integer index into the SBT, specifying 
    the hitprogram group and program data to be executed 

-21:53
    problem: you have to get **four** different things to match:

    a) order of build inputs in GAS(es)
    b) numSBTRecords and sbtOffsets in ASes build inputs
    c) index and stride values passed to optixTrace
    d) the size and order of elements in your SBT 

    Of those four, "d" is the most flexible (and fully under your control) 
    -> this is where you have to make it all match 

    * get this wrong means rays will call the wring programs with wring data
 
-21:18
    SBT : linear array of "SBT Records"

    Each SBT Record
   
    * has a "header" which specifies which program group to execute 
      (stores function pointers, like a virtual method table)
    * has a "payload" or "body" that gets passed to programs as "program data"

      * you choose what to put there
      * has to have the same size (pad smaller elements) 
      * has to satisfy some alignment criteria
      * pointers must point to device memory 
      * programs need to be able to digest the SBT record body  
 

-20:17
   There are actually three such arrays of SBT records for:

   * pointers to RayGen programs + RayGen data
   * pointers to Miss programs + Miss data
   * pointers to HitGroup programs + HitGroup data    (HitGroup: IN/CH) 

   The first two are simple. Usually get problems with the HitGroup SBT.
  
-19:07
   Building/using the SBT involves six steps:

   a) determine the size and order of SBT elements
   b) "build" the SBT entries
   c) upload SBT arrays to device
   d) specify SBT to use during launch
   e) specify "stride" and "offset" to use for each optixTrace call
   f) access SBT data in shader programs

-18:54
   Step b) build

   1. plant "PG function pointers" into header of SBT entry : optixSbtRecordPackHeader(programGroupToUse, sbtRecord.header)
   2. copy the data into body of SBT entry

-18:20
   Step c) upload

   Setup CPU side OptixShaderBindingTable sbt, fill in
   pointers, stride and count for each of the three SBT (raygen, miss, hitgroup) 

   * stride must be a multiple of required alignment 
   * miss, raygen, hitgroup can each have different size 
     but all elements of each array have the same size 


-17:26
   Step d) launch with particular sbt

   * sbt struct is in host mem but arrays it points to are in device mem


-17:13
   Step e) specify stride and offset during launch 

   In raygen, assume ONE ray tyoe

   int sbtStride = 1 ; // num ray types
   int sbtOffset = 0 ; // the ray type
   int sbtMissIndex = 0 ; // the ray type -> which miss program to call when a miss happens

   optixTrace(traversable, ray.origin, ..., sbtOffset,sbtStride,sbtMissIndex, ... )

-16:10
   Assume we traced a slide (with given stride/offset values)...

   * and it hit a triangle/prim in a given instance
   * of a given GAS
   * and that this triangle belongs to the i-th build input for this GAS

   ::

       ias
          i0
             gas0
                bi0 (numSBT=1)
                bi1 (numSBT=1)
          i1
             gas1
                bi0 (numSBT=1)
                bi1 (numSBT=1) 
                bi2 (numSBT=1)
          i2
             gas0
                bi0 
                bi1 
          i3
             gas1
                bi0 
                *bi1*    i3.sbtOffset
                bi2
          i4
             gas0
                bi0 
                bi1 
          i5
             gas1
                bi0 
                bi1 
                bi2
 


          gas0


-15:51
    SBT : what happens under the hood

    a) get the sbtOffset value from the instance we hit -> instOffset 
    b) compute a second offset based on which build input in the GAS we hit -> gasOffset
       eg: 

       * if the GAS has build inputs : A,B,C,D each with numSBT=1 
       * and the prim we hit came from build input C
       * then the GASoffset will be num_A+num_B = 1 + 1 = 2  (for A it would be 0) 

       * Q: what about multiple GAS ?

-14:44

    c) Take sbtOffset and sbtStride from optixTrace call
    d) compute final SBT index::

       int sbtIdx = ray.sbtOffset + instOffset + ray.sbtStride*blasOffset 
       void* addr = (sbtIdx)*sbt.sbtIndexStrideInBytes + sbtBase

    e) call program packed in sbt[sbtIdx].header with data sbt[sbtIdx].body 


-14:22
    So, what about the order of SBT(HitGroup) elements

    Basically, order has to match what this formula computes:

    * all entries from same BLAS/GAS should be in one block 
    * all entries from same BLAS/GAS must match order of build inputs
    * instance sbtOffsets point to where in the SBT the referenced BLAS/GAS starts


-13:18
    eg one BLAS/GAS G with meshes A,B,C one instance I of G 

    * SBT contains { sbtRecord(A), sbtRecord{B}, sbtRecord{C} }
    * I.sbtOffset = 0 
    * ray.sbtOffset = 0, ray.sbtStride = 1 

-12:14
    Another example
  
    * one BLAS G with {A,B,C}
    * 2nd BLAS H woth {D,E}
    * one instance IG (of G) and one IH(of H) in same IAS

    Then:

    * SBT is {A,B,C,D,E}  (first all inputs from G, then all from H)
    * IG.sbtIffset : 0  (offset if A, first entry in G, in the SBT)
    * IH.sbtOffset : 3  (offset of D, first entry in H, in the SBT)

    Note : could have swapped order to {D,E,A,B,A}
    so long as contiguous within each BLAS/GAS

-11:51
    More complicated

    * G = {A,B,C}    H = {E,F}
    * Two instances IG0, IG1 in one IAS + ine instance IH in another IAS

    * SBT is still {A,B,C,D,E}  (build inputs for BLAS/GASes didnt change)
    
    * IG0.sbtOffset : 0
    * IG1.sbtOffset : 0   (both same as same BLAS/GAS with same SBT records)  

    * IH.sbtOffset : 3 (still 3, no matter what IASes there are)  

    [so in this usage pattern the SBT is acting more as an index to the build inputs]
    [that is advantageous for a small SBT, but means instance specifics needs to be handled 
    some other way]


-10:40
     For different ray types to execute different programs
     for same mesh -> need multiple different SBT entries for each mesh (one per ray type)

     Different ways of doing this, "best known method"

     * create N successive SBT entries for each build input (N=num ray types) 
     * adjust the instance offsets
     * pass offset=rayType, stride=N to optixTrace 

-10:02
     Example G={A,B,C} H={E,F} and IG,IH again, but with 2 ray types
    
     * SBT : {A0,A1,B0,B1,C0,C1,E0,E1,F0,F1} 
     * bodies of those entries typically the same
     * optixTrace offset=rayType, stride=2

-08:29
     CAREFUL pitfall: rayStride does not get multiplied into inst.sbtOffset
     
     * so IH.sbtOffset must now change to 6 (from 3)  
     * BLAS/GAS build input for A:F still all numSBTRecords=1 
       because that does get multipled
    
       * think of numSBTRecords as "1 *set* of entries per mesh"

-05:18
     optixLaunch is async, need to cudaStreamSynchronize(stream) to control 
  
     * frame may not be ready until after Synchronize(stream)
       
-04:49
     launch param 

     * fast, lightweight way of passing data 
     * per-frame changing values without SBT rebuild
     * can have multiple launches in flight in parallel 

       * [hmm so each launch gets its own constant memory block] 





    





Dynamic Advice from Vishal
-------------------------------

Regarding the dynamic size of data inferred at runtime.
SBT data lives in GPU global memory like cudaMalloc() 
So, to allow dynamic size is by doing:
 
1. cudaMalloc(&d_data, size);  // size is dynamic
2. packing the pointer in optixLaunch() params. in this you can set params.<var> = d_data to the allocated data.

OR

1. cudaMalloc(&d_data, size);  // size is dynamic
2. then set the pointer d_data to a variable in SBTRecord data structure. So::

    struct HitGroup_CSG_Data
    {
        float *values = d_data;
    };


optix_stubs.h
--------------

::

    // The function table needs to be defined in exactly one translation unit. This can be
    // achieved by including optix_function_table_definition.h in that translation unit.
    extern OptixFunctionTable g_optixFunctionTable;

12:25 BVH flatten scene

   Example : modelling two cars with wheels, 

   * should you instance the wheels and the cars or just copy the wheels into car instances 
   * its faster to keep it flatter, ie copy the wheels into two car instances 

   * Hardware Instancing : your first level is free!

     * ie it can handle one level of descent into a smaller BVH 

   * flatten if you can, ie if you have the memory  
   * better to avoid overlapped BVHs

   BVH : one level of instancing comes for free (ie RT cores handle it)


16:24 Reduce memory access

    Quadro RTX 6000 memory bandwidth : 672 GB/s
    *IF* 10 GRays/s is goal, then :

    672 GB/s /  10 GRays/s = 67.2 bytes/ray  (includes traversal)

    => Care must be taken to stay in this budget
    => way to calculate the upper bound of the ray tracer
  
    ::

       BUT : for me, I dont need to pull all the photons back to 
       the GPU, only interested in those that hit PMTs : so I think
       this memory bandwidth should not be a problem

dhart : Writing to Buffer
----------------------------

* https://forums.developer.nvidia.com/t/how-to-write-from-closesthit-to-a-device-buffer/110361

I recommend studying the OptiX 7 example called “optixRaycasting”. This sample
is structured to write the ray tracing results to a buffer, which is then
processed by a separate CUDA kernel.

This should give you some ideas of how to handle your payload and the mechanics
of writing to a buffer. If it doesn’t answer your questions, please write back
and we can offer more guidance.

Nsight Compute, Nsight Systems, and Nsight VSE (on Windows), should all work
reasonably well with OptiX 7, as long as you’re using a very recent driver.
cuda-gdb works on Linux, though it’s not as well supported as Nsight.

You can use atomics to prevent two threads from writing to the same memory
address. The best advice for performance is to try hard to avoid needing
atomics, but you can use them if you need. There is a bit more information
about what is allowed here:
