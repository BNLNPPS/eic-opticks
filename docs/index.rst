eic-opticks Documentation
=========================

GPU-accelerated optical photon simulation using NVIDIA OptiX and Geant4.

This package interfaces NVIDIA OptiX with Geant4 to accelerate optical photon
transport for physics experiments. It supports detector geometries defined in
the GDML format and is based on the work by Simon Blyth, whose original Opticks
framework can be found `here <https://simoncblyth.bitbucket.io/opticks/>`_.
