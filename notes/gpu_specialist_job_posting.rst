Hi Tao, 

Following our discussion this morning, there are 
some ideas below for what to translate into the 
job posting.

*(Job Title)*

High Energy Physics GPU Computing Specialist 

*(Please describe the responsibilities, job content and job requirements of the
job you are applying for)*

IHEP-CAS has an opening for a high energy physics GPU computing specialist 

In this role you will work on solving the computing challenges of frontier
experiments at IHEP, including the Jiangmen Underground Neutrino Observatory, JUNO.
The ending of Moore's law and increases in experimental data volumes
make traditional computing models no longer affordable.  Instead acceleration
technologies such as GPUs must be applied to solve computing challenges. 
GPU parallel processing makes possible incredible performance enhancements, however
reaching this level demands a total reorganization of data structures and
computation into GPU optimized forms.

JUNO will soon become the world's largest scintillator detector with many tens
of thousands of photomultiplier tubes presenting computational challenges
across all areas of simulation, calibration, reconstruction, analysis and
visualization. Cosmic muons crossing the large, high yield JUNO scintillator
result in many millions of optical photons per muon which presents memory and
computation bottlenecks for simulation. The initial focus of this position is
on the time critical requirements of the JUNO experiment to eliminate these
resource bottlenecks by offloading the optical photon simulation to the GPU.
In addition GPU techniques will be applied to solve computational problems
arising in other areas. 

It is expected that developments will as much as possible be openly shared with
the entire HEP community via contributions to open source projects such as
Opticks and substantial contributions to the Geant4 Collaboration and through
the HEP Software Foundation.

In addition the sharing of expertise on cutting edge techniques and occasional
training of colleagues are essential aspects of this position. 

*(Please describe in detail the requirements of the position for the
applicant's academic qualifications, work experience, work ability and related
skills)* 

The ideal candidate will have the following qualifications and experience:

* Doctoral degree in experimental high energy particle physics 
* Proven history of architecting innovative software to solve computational problems 
* Comprehensive software development experience in languages including: C, C++, Python
* Deep GPU development experience and familiarity with NVIDIA software including CUDA and Thrust 
* Experience with the translation of data models into GPU appropriate forms, including the use of GPU textures
* Development experience with GPU ray tracing and NVIDIA OptiX 
* Experience with the Opticks GPU optical photon simulation package 
* Experience of 3D graphics software development with OpenGL or Vulkan
* Deep experience with the Geant4 simulation toolkit and willingness to develop source code 
 level understanding of geometry and optical physics
* Experience of porting Geant4 simulation software to CUDA 
* Experience in software testing, performance analysis and monitoring
* Ability to rapidly evaluate and learn new programming languages, frameworks
 and techniques as necessary  
* Ability to evaluate open source software projects and integrate them with
 experiment frameworks 
* Experience of making the architectural changes necessary to profit from
 massively parallel processing 
* Willingness to develop for all common operating systems: Linux, macOS, Windows 
* Ability to communicate cutting edge computing techniques to diverse audiences
 and a willingness for occasional teaching  


*(Please describe in detail the necessity and urgency of recruiting foreign
researchers for this position)*

The JUNO experiment will soon be collecting data. The scale of the detector
with many tens of thousands of photomultiplier tubes and the high yield
scintillator which will produce tens of millions of photons for each cosmic
muon means there are huge computational challenges that traditional CPU
processing cannot cost-effectively solve. 

GPU processing can solve many of these problems but it requires a large
software effort in order to do so.  Very few people worldwide have the
combination of experience across high energy physics and GPU parallel
processing.  We need to attract a HEP computing specialist with this very rare
skillset and deep experience in order to both directly perform the work and in
order to raise the skill level of our experts.

Such unique individuals will inevitably be well known within the HEP computing
community with deep contacts within the Geant4 Collaboration and HEP Software
Foundation. We wish to use the connections of such individuals to deepen the
contacts of our experts and to increase our engagement with the worldwide HEP
software community. This community develops the software which is a mission
critical component of all IHEP experiments. It is a strategic necessity to
deepen our engagement with this community in order to ensure that this critical
software continues to fulfil the needs of our experiments.


*(job objective : Please describe in detail the expected goals and results of
the position applied for during the contract period)*

It now looks almost certain that the Opticks GPU optical photon simulation approach
will solve the problem of optical photon simulation by offloading the optical
photon simulation entirely to the GPU.  Performance comparisons with
traditional approaches show a speedup factor greater than 1500x which will be
transformative for optical photon simulation. As a result much larger muon
simulation samples will be able to be created and our detector understanding
will no longer be limited by computational and memory bottlenecks. This greater
understanding will allow optimal muon veto requirements to be developed
which will increase the live time and hence the physics performance of the JUNO
detector which will maximizes the precision of all JUNO physics measurements.

The leap in the simulation performance due to GPU techniques is expected to
motivate many more people to adopt GPU processing in other areas such as
reconstruction, calibration and analysis. The transition to GPU based data
processing requires fundamentally different data structures and approaches that
demand considerable re-learning from physicists and developers. The
extensive GPU experience and teaching ability of the candidate we are seeking
will greatly assist with this transition and will accelerate the widespread
adoption of this new approach to data processing within JUNO and beyond.  
The raised skill level will enable JUNO to meet its data processing challenges.

The candidate we are seeking will make important contributions to the Geant4 
simulation toolkit bringing the benefits of GPU optical photon simulation to 
a worldwide audience both inside the HEP community and beyond. 
Scientists from many experiments across the world are already evaluating Opticks, 
including core Geant4 developers from CERN and Fermilab who are investigating 
deeper integration of Opticks with Geant4 and potential for using Opticks 
geometry modelling and intersection innovations for the simulation of electromagnetic 
showers in HL-LHC calorimeters.

The transition to GPU processing in HEP software is an opportunity for IHEP to
take a leading role in shaping the future in a way which will make a fundamental 
contribution to the worldwide HEP community and ensure that mission critical 
software fulfils the requirements of the IHEP experiments. 
Engaging the candidate that we seek will put IHEP at the cutting edge of 
GPU usage in HEP software, will boost the skill level of our experts and 
enable a leading position in this strategic area to be established.
