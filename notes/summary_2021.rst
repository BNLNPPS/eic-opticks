JUNO Opticks Progress Summary 2021

From scratch development of a shared GPU+CPU geometry model enabling 
state-of-the-art NVIDIA OptiX 7 ray tracing of CSG based detector geometries, 
flattened into a two-level structure for optimal performance harnessing ray trace 
dedicated NVIDIA GPU hardware. Development was guided by frequent consultation with NVIDIA engineers. 

JUNO Opticks development, validation and performance testing revealed issues with PMT 
and Fastener geometry, Cerenkov photon generation and PMT parameter services.
This has led to improved geometry modelling, Cerenkov numerical integration
and sampling and PMT services resulting in substantial improvements to the correctness
and performance of the JUNO Geant4 and Opticks based simulations.
