Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is the process of optimizing the output of
a large language model, so it references an authoritative knowledge base
outside of its training data sources before generating a response. Large
Language Models (LLMs) are trained on vast volumes of data and use billions of
parameters to generate original output for tasks like answering questions,
translating languages, and completing sentences. RAG extends the already
powerful capabilities of LLMs to specific domains or an organization's internal
knowledge base, all without the need to retrain the model. It is a
cost-effective approach to improving LLM output so it remains relevant,
accurate, and useful in various contexts.

Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) is an architecture for optimizing the
performance of an artificial intelligence (AI) model by connecting it with
external knowledge bases. RAG helps large language models (LLMs) deliver more
relevant responses at a higher quality.
