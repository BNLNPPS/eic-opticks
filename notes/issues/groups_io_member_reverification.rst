groups_io_member_reverification
==================================



Dear Simon Blyth,

You are receiving this email because you are an owner or moderator of one or
more Groups.io groups. We are in the process of reverifying some of our users
and we wanted to make sure you knew what was happening and why. For more detail
about this, please visit the Reverification FAQ, at
https://groups.io/static/reverifyfaq

On Saturday January 13th, 2024, an anti-spam service called Spamhaus labeled
one of our email servers as a spam sender. This caused any email service that
uses Spamhaus to stop accepting email from our server. Because of this, we
began a reverification process and sent out reverification emails to a subset
of our users on Sunday January 14th. Spamhaus lifted their block on Monday,
January 15th, 2024, but we need to continue the reverification process.

You can see which, if any, of your users are affected. Go to the Admin section
of your group and look at the Members page. Next to each user's email, there
may be a badge with the letters RI or RS. RI means the
confirmation/reverification is in progress, but has not been completed. RS
means the confirmation/reverification has been successfully completed.

    Checking the members page shows only my ihep email in RI state, there are no RS

Here are the next steps in the reverification process:

    On Sunday, January 28th, group emails to people in the RI state will be
    disabled. Messages from moderators and login link emails will still work.
    Until February 11th, people will still be able to reverify themselves and the
    RI and RS badges will still show up in the Members page.  After that, members
    still in the RI state will be removed from groups. The activity log entry will
    be Membership - Member Removed, with the added reason of reverification failed.

For domains where no reverifications happened, no invites or direct adds will
be permitted going forward. If there is a valid person on one of those domains,
they should contact support@groups.io to have the domain ban lifted.

We apologize for the inconvenience this process may cause, but it is necessary
to ensure that we are able to continue delivering group email reliably. Thank
you for using Groups.io.

Best Regards,
The Groups.io Team
