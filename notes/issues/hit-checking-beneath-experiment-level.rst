hit-checking-beneath-experiment-level
======================================


Need way to check hits and the G4Opticks API for getting them etc..  
without ascending to the level of the experiment.

Obvious place is g4ok/tests/G4OKTest.cc but that is
painful as not using cache.

TODO:

* provide a way for G4Opticks to boot from cache 
* hmm running from cache means cannot provide origin sensor placements...
