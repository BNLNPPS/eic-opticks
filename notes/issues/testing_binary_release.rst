testing_binary_release
========================

Relevant scripts:

okdist--
   creates tarball and test explodes it into eg /usr/local/opticks_release   
   OR more specifically::

       /usr/local/opticks_release/Opticks-0.0.1_alpha/i386-10.13.6-gcc4.2.1-geant4_10_04_p02-dbg/


bin/opticks-site.bash
   configure access to opticks binary release

bin/opticks-site-local.bash 
   customization of opticks-site.bash via bash functions



bin/opticks-release.bash
    minimal environment for use of binary release

    HUH: this is nice and simple but looks very 
    incomplete : it needs to hook into opticks-setup somehow ?
 



HMM different levels of environment setup
---------------------------------------------


~/.opticks_config
    development environment for access to opticks pre-requisites and 
    externals which also (somewhat dirtily) invokes opticks-setup 

opticks-setup
    bash function that sources the script at the path returned 
    by opticks-setup-path namely $(opticks-prefix)/bin/opticks-setup.sh
    that was generated by opticks-setup-generate

bin/opticks-setup.sh
    (opticks-setup-vi to view the generated setup)
