G4OKTest-pro-dev-switch-changes-hits-none-with-pro
====================================================


Observe that flipping the OPTICKS_EMBEDDED_COMMANDLINE from default of "pro" 
to "dev" makes hits get reported where none are reported with "pro".

Investigate this.  Perhaps the hits are there just not reported due to no "--save"
